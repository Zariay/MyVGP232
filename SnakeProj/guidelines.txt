This assignment is about exercising your new found skills with NAnt. This is our first use of a real build system and to demonstrate that it can be a complete replacement of Visual Studio I would like you to use NAnt to build a C# project. Using the provided ConsoleSnake project as reference, create a NAnt .build file that is capable of compiling the ConsoleSnake game.

For hand in please place your .build script in the VGP232 Assignment folder by 6:00 on Monday.

Some quick notes about the project:
-It is built using the .net 2.0 framework and is a console app. This means you will need to set the NAnt selected framework as "net-2.0".
-There are no embedded resources, no .resx's to worry about
-The list of references can be obtained from the .csproj
-The type of app is a console app, so use target="exe" and not "winexe"
